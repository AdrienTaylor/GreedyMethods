In this repository, you will find resources for the article entitled "Efficient First-order Methods for Convex Minimization: a Constructive Approach". Content:

(1) Files for generating the worst-case comparisons between the different methods (fast gradient, triple momentum and optimized gradient) for miminimizing smooth (strongly) convex functions, using the Performance Estimation Toolbox
(available at https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox).

(2) Files to generate the step sizes for the SSEP-based gradient method for smooth strongly convex minimization.

----- Setup

In order to use the code, the user should have YALMIP installed, along
with some semidefinite solver (e.g. Mosek, Sedumi, SDPT3, ...).

Once YALMIP and the SDP solver installed, the user can put the code in the
directory of his choice and execute the demo file step by step.
