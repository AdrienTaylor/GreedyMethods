# GreedyMethods_ProofsValidations

In this repository, you will find the files used to
(1) verify symbolically (in Mathematica) the convergence proof for the greedy first-order method presented in the work 
    "A Constructive Approach to Efficient First-order Methods for Convex Minimization" 
(2) generate the worst-case comparisons between the different methods (fast gradient, triple momentum and optimized gradient)
for miminimizing a smooth strongly convex function, using the Performance Estimation Toolbox
(available at https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox).
