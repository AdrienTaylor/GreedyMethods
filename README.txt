# GreedyMethods_ProofsValidations

In this repository, you will find
(1) Files for generating the worst-case comparisons between the different methods (fast gradient, triple momentum and optimized gradient) for miminimizing smooth (strongly) convex functions, using the Performance Estimation Toolbox
(available at https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox).
(2) Files to generate the step sizes for the SSEP-based gradient method for smooth strongly convex minimization.
